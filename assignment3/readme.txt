I tried to make a blog website I found on internet.
I have created this template with the help of BOOTSTRAP4 and have also included AOS- library for certain effects like fadeit,fadeout and so on...

Key Features:-
-> made with BOOTSTRAP
-> use of preloader
-> template is responsive (to some extent) i.e. made for all types of screen sizes.
-> various animations are used (like fadein,fadeout from AOS library)
-> use of Jquery to trigger certain animations
